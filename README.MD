# Welcome

[Developer Sojourn](https://developersojourn.site) is a place to relax, learn and experiment with new technologies. I attempt to put into practice everything that I learn about programming for the web, ranging from flashing visuals to the less obvious but equally important back-end setup.

I also write about my personal experience learning how to write code, mostly in the format of note taking blog posts, but I will try to keep the content mixed with some personal thoughts, news and other articles I find interesting. The main topics are about web development, game development and graphics, system administration, etc.

This portfolio is a work in progress, and it always will as I change things around, throw in new technologies to the stack, follow on design trends and find other overly complicated ways to have some fun with code.

Any feedback is much appreciated, I always welcome tips on how to improve my coding and designing skills. You can also just drop me a message to say hi or share your own work with me. Enjoy your visit!
